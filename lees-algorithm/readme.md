# Shortest path in a maze â€“ Lee Algorithm

Run using `python3 pathfinder.py`

### Problem
Given a 2-d maze in the form of the binary rectangular matrix, find the shortest pathâ€™s length in a maze from a given source to a given destination.

Lee's algorithm is optimal for maze routing problems where nodes are connected bu edges of equal weight. This algorithm is based on the Breadthâ€“first search. It always gives an optimal solution, if one exists, but is slow and requires considerable memory.
